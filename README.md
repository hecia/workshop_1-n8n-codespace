# HEC IA - Workshop 1 - Agentic AI with n8n

We will use **n8n** running in a GitHub Codespace to build AI Agents.
> Your Github Student Pack gives you free access to Github Codespaces :)

Please follow these steps **before the session** to ensure your environment is ready.

## 1. Prerequisites
* **GitHub Student Developer Pack:** Required to use Codespaces for free. [Activate it here](https://education.github.com/pack).
* **Google AI Studio Key:** You will need an API key for the workshop. [Get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## 2. Launching the Environment
1.  Click the green **Code** button at the top of this repository.
2.  Select the **Codespaces** tab.
3.  Click **Create codespace on main**.
4.  Wait for the container to build (approx. 2 minutes).

## 3. Accessing n8n
Once the terminal is active:
1.  Look at the bottom panel in VS Code (Browser) and click the **PORTS** tab.
2.  Locate **Port 5678** (n8n Interface).
3.  Click the **Globe Icon** (Open in Browser) or the provided URL.

## 4. Verification
* You should see a screen titled **"Set up your owner account"**.
* **Action:** Create a local account (you can use a fake email and password, this data stays in your temporary container).
* Skip the form by answering "I'm not using n8n for work".
* If you see the n8n workflow canvas or a list of workflows, **you are ready**.

*See you on Wednesday.*
